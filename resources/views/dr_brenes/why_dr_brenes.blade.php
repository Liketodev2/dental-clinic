                        <p>Dr. Brenes started his training at an early age (literally) because both his parents were dentists. When he came home from school every day, he went to his parents’ office to do homework. He tells of his memories of painful faces coming in and smiling faces walking out. Young Alberto Brenes becoming Dr. Alberto Brenes DDS was a foregone conclusion.

                        </p>
                        <p>He remembers asking his father (The slightly older gentleman in the picture), what’s the most important thing to know, to become the best dentist?
                            His father told him that “the list was long, but the most important thing you can give your patient is “Empathy””.
                            “To most people Dentistry is a necessary evil, people come in with pain. Many have neglected dental work for too long because of fear, no money and/or health reasons. You can’t just put them in a chair and fix their teeth, you must have “Empathy” to what their feeling and ease their concerns to the best of your ability, before you can help them with the best dental care”
                        </p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <p>He asked his father, “what should I study in Dental college, what’s the best way to help”.
                            The answer was simple, “learn everything, no one patient is the same and they’re all much more than just a filling”
                        </p>

                        <p>Lastly his father said, always remember to give back to the people who taught you, by helping to teach others and tell all your patients “Be true to your teeth and they’ll never be false to you”!
                        </p>
                        <p>At the University of Costa Rica Dental School (Facultad de Odontologia) Dr. Brenes got his DDS.
                            It took 6 years, not because he was a slow learner, but because he took his father’s advice and learned every discipline of Dentistry, including everything from implants to prosthetics, from fillings to the Front Office. </p>
                        <p>Starting his practice at his fathers’ office gave him the overflow of clients his parents had garnered in their many years at this location in Alajuela, right next to the Capital city’s main airport (SJO).
                            It turned out that his leaning became even more robust with the nuances his parents continued to instill in him.</p>
                        <p>“It seems like schooling never stopped” as he believed in what his parents said about giving back. Now a teaching professor back at UCR College he fulfills his obligations to give back and to pass the knowledge forward to new dental students. The benefits are endless he says, not only am I helping others but I’m on the cutting edge of the newest and safest technology in this ever-changing world of dentistry.
                        </p>
                        <p>A second location near the college became inevitable due to the many clients he met while donating his time at the university.

                        </p>
                        <p>To sum things up, Dr. Brenes is an early student of the craft, taught by parents who cared, a well-rounded fully trained Dentist with years of experience, and a Professor of Dentistry at the State of the Art Dentistry Department in Costa Rica Univercity..</p>
                        <p style="color: #23B479;font-weight: 600;font-size: 25px;">
                            This is why Dr. Brenes!
